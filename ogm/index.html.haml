          === JPA for NoSQL solutions

          Hibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) aims at providing Java Persistence (JPA) support for NoSQL solutions.

          It reuses Hibernate Core's engine but persists entities into a NoSQL data store instead of a relational database. It reuses the Java Persistence Query Language (JP-QL) to search their data.

          That's the grand scheme of things and we will roll out functionalities over time.

          ==== Short term targets

          * support for Infinispan (done)
          * support Hibernate Search full-text queries (done)
          * support simple JP-QL queries (restrictions and many-to-one joins)

          ==== Medium term targets

          * support other key/value stores
          * support other NoSQL families
          * support complex joins and aggregations
